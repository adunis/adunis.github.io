The dragons were incredibly powerful, with a variety of abilities including fire and ice breath, flight, and immense physical strength. They were able to lay waste to entire cities and armies with ease, and even other fantasy races such as elves and dwarves were unable to withstand their power.\n\nThe Flamebreathers were led by the great red dragon, Zephyros, and controlled much of southern Europe including the Iberian Peninsula and Italy, while the Frostwings were led by the powerful white dragon, Boreas, and dominated much of northern Europe including Scandinavia and Russia. The dragons had enslaved the orcs, using them as soldiers in their armies and forcing them to do their bidding.\n\nHumanity was led by a coalition of nations including England, France, and the Holy Roman Empire, and was supported by the elves of the Germanic regions and the dwarves of the Alpine region. Despite being vastly outnumbered and outmatched by the dragons, humanity was able to mount a formidable defense due to their ingenuity and tenacity. They employed a variety of tactics including the use of ballistae and trebuchets to take down the dragons in flight, and the use of enchanted weapons to penetrate their tough hides.\n\nThe War of the Dragons was a turning point in the history of Europe and the world, with the dragons being defeated by humanity in the year 1378, thanks to the combined efforts of the various factions. The orcs were freed from their slavery, and the dragons were forced to retreat to their respective regions, where they remained for centuries to come.</p> "
